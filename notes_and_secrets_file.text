*NOTES*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The order of the backends listed in the settings/AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS setting matters. If the
same credentials are valid for multiple backends, Django will stop at the first backend that
successfully authenticates the user.

In this project, I learned how to build an authentication system for your site. You implemented all
the necessary views for users to register, log in, log out, edit their password, and reset their password.
You built a model for custom user profiles, and you created a custom authentication backend to let
users log into your site using their email address.
