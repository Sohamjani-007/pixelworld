*NOTES*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The order of the backends listed in the settings/AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS setting matters. If the
same credentials are valid for multiple backends, Django will stop at the first backend that
successfully authenticates the user.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this project, I learned how to build an authentication system for your site. You implemented all
the necessary views for users to register, log in, log out, edit their password, and reset their password.
You built a model for custom user profiles, and you created a custom authentication backend to let
users log into your site using their email address.

The management command runserver_plus provided by Django Extensions to run the
development server, as follows:
python manage.py runserver_plus --cert-file cert.crt

FOR BOOKMARKING:
For security reasons, your browser will prevent you from running the bookmarklet over HTTP on a site
served through HTTPS. That’s the reason we keep using RunServerPlus to run the development server
using an auto-generated TLS/SSL certificate. Remember that you learned how to run the development
server through HTTPS in Chapter 5, Implementing Social Authentication.

In a production environment, a valid TLS/SSL certificate will be required. When you own a domain
name, you can apply for a trusted Certification Authority (CA) to issue a TLS/SSL certificate for it, so
that browsers can verify its identity. If you want to obtain a trusted certificate for a real domain, you
can use the Let’s Encrypt service. Let’s Encrypt is a nonprofit CA that simplifies obtaining and renewing
trusted TLS/SSL certificates for free. You can find more information at https://letsencrypt.org.
